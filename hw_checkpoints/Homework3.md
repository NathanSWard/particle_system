1)  - Have implemented basic particle systems and finalize design of the particle system policy interface.
2)  - All of the above was accomplished, however, it would have been preferable to have more particle system implementations. (currently only `snow` and `explosion` are available).  
3)  - For the next deadline, I will have the ability to switch and create different particle systems at runtime (mostly likely via a mouse/keyboard key press).

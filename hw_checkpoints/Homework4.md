#### What is planned to do:
- To have the ability to switch and create different particle systems at runtime (mostly likely via a mouse/keyboard key press).
#### What I accomplished:
- While I did not accomplish this task exactly, I instead provided the ability to modify running particles system at runtime. 
- For example: A particle system can follow the mouse position and change color/emission rate based on key presses.
#### What I will accomplish by the final deadline:
- The ability to completely remove/add arbitrary particle systems at runtime via mouse/keyboard input.
- At least 5 different particle system implementations that the user can switch between.

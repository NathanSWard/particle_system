#### What is planned to do:
- The ability to completely remove/add arbitrary particle systems at runtime via mouse/keyboard input.
- At least 5 different particle system implementations that the user can switch between.
#### What I accomplished:
- I was able to successfully complete the first task. The particle_system_manager now allows users to more easily add and remove emitters at runtime.
- I was also able to hook these to various inputs.
- I did not implement 5 different particle systems (only 3) but that was plenty for the required presentation.
- Plus the purpose of this project was to show how a developer could theoretically use my manager class within their own development cycle.
